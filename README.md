# cloud_project
It's a college project for CSCI 8000 Cloud Computing
Description->
We have created an IOS and Android application which uses tensorflow model to recognize objects in an image. These applications will be used to create benchmarks of using machine learning on mobile devices. This would help us in determining if a future machine learning application can be efficiently deployed on mobile devices.
